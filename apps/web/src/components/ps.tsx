    Why Water Gets Wasted
  </h2>

  <p className="text-gray-700">
    Most households don’t waste water intentionally.
    The real issue is that people don’t clearly know how much water they are using,
    or what is considered too much.

  <p className="text-gray-700">
    WaterWise helps households turn daily water usage into clear visuals
    and simple explanations, so small problems can be fixed before they
    become serious shortages.
